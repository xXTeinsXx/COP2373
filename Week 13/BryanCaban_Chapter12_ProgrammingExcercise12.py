Student Grade Analysis Program
------------------------------
Author: Bryan Caban
Assignment: Chapter 12 Programming Exercise 12

Overview:
This program analyzes student grade data stored in a CSV file using NumPy for numerical operations.
It provides statistical insights into student performance by calculating various metrics for each exam
and for the overall dataset.

Things the  program does:
- Loads student grade data from a CSV file
- Calculates mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each exam
- Determines pass/fail statistics for each exam (passing grade is 60 or above)
- Calculates overall statistics across all exams
- Provides user-friendly interface for file selection and program execution
